# Exploratory Data Analysis
## World Population Data
In this project I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis on world population data that i found online. The aim was to discover high level insights like: what countries had the higest population, how continents stacked up against each other in terms of population, the population growth of each continent over the years (1970-2022), top level statistics of the data (mean,percentiles,count etc), and the correlation between data points eg. the correlation between Area and population etcetera, etcetera

Tech Stack: 
IDE:Jupyter Notebooks on Visual Studio Code
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation),matplotlib and seaborn (for data visualization)
